This is the first assignment I have completed with a lot of hard work, and now I understand how HTML and CSS actually work. I have used various HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap elements and attributes, such as divs, lists, margins, borders, and many more. This project has truly helped me build and enhance my UI design skills.
